This binary distribution of FXRuby is specifically
packaged to work with the latest One-Click Ruby
Installer, available for download from this page:

http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubyinstaller

This distribution should contain just about everything
you'd want to get started working with FXRuby; the
documentation is installed under:

C:\ruby\doc\ruby\FXRuby

the sample programs are installed under:

C:\ruby\samples\FXRuby

and the libraries are installed under:

C:\ruby\lib\ruby\site_ruby\1.8

This distribution doesn't include the C++ source code
used to build FXRuby. For that you should download the
full source code distribution from the FXRuby home page.
