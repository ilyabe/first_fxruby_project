/**
* An icon source is a class that loads an icon of any type.
* It exists purely for convenience, to make loading icons
* simpler by concentrating the knowledge of the supported
* icon formats in a single place.
* Needless to say, this class is subclassable, allowing users
* to add additional icon types and make them available to
* all widgets which deal with icons.
* Note, the icons are loaded, but NOT created (realized) yet;
* this allows users to manipulate the pixel data prior to
* realizing the icons.
