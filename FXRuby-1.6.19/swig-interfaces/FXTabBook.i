/**
* The tab book layout manager arranges pairs of children;
* the even numbered children (0,2,4,...) are usually tab items,
* and are placed on the top.  The odd numbered children are
* usually layout managers, and are placed below; all the odd
* numbered children are placed on top of each other, similar
* to the switcher widget.  When the user presses one of the
* tab items, the tab item is raised above the neighboring tabs,
* and the corresponding panel is raised to the top.
* Thus, a tab book can be used to present many GUI controls
* in a small space by placing several panels on top of each
* other and using tab items to select the desired panel.
* When one of the tab items is pressed, the tab book's setCurrent()
* is called with notify=TRUE.  Thus causes the tab book to send a
* SEL_COMMAND message to its target.
