* The Icon Dictionary manages a collection of icons.  The icons are referenced
* by their file name.  When first encountering a new file name, the icon is
* located by searching the icon search path for the icon file.  If found, the
* services of the icon source object are used to load the icon from the file.
* A custom icon source may be installed to furnish support for additonal 
* image file formats.
* Once the icon is loaded, an association between the icon name and the icon
* is entered into the icon dictionary.  Subsequent searches for an icon with
* this name will be satisfied from the cached value.
* The lifetype of the icons is managed by the icon dictionary, and thus all
* icons will be deleted when the dictionary is deleted.
