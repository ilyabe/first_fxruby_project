/**
* The Matrix layout manager automatically arranges its child windows
* in rows and columns.  If the matrix style is MATRIX_BY_ROWS, then
* the matrix will have the given number of rows and the number of columns
* grows as more child windows are added; if the matrix style is MATRIX_BY_COLUMNS,
* then the number of columns is fixed and the number of rows grows as more children
* are added.  
* If all children in a row (column) have the LAYOUT_FILL_ROW (LAYOUT_FILL_COLUMN)
* hint set, then the row (column) will be stretchable as the matrix layout manager
* itself is resized.  If more than one row (column) is stretchable, the space is
* apportioned to each stretchable row (column) proportionally.
* Within each cell of the matrix, all other layout hints are observed.  
* For example, a child having LAYOUT_CENTER_Y and LAYOUT_FILL_X hints will
* be centered in the Y-direction, while being stretched in the X-direction.
* Empty cells can be obtained by simply placing a borderless FXFrame widget
* as a space-holder.
