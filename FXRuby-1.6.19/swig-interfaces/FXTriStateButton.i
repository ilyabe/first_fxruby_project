/**
* The tri-state button provides a three-state button, which toggles between the
* on and the off state each time it is pressed; programmatically, it may also be
* switched into the MAYBE state.  The MAYBE state is useful to signify an unknown
* state in the application data.
* Like the toggle button, it sends a SEL_COMMAND to its target, with the
* message data set to the current state of the toggle button, of the type FXbool.
