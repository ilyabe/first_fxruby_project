/**
* The dock site widget is a widget where dock bars can be docked.
* Dock site widgets are typically embedded inside the main window, placed
* against those sides where docking of toolbars is to be allowed.
* Dock bars placed inside a dock site are laid out in horizontal or vertical bands
* called galleys.  A toolbar with the LAYOUT_DOCK_SAME hint is preferentially placed
* on the same galley as its previous sibling.  A dock bar with the LAYOUT_DOCK_NEXT is
* always placed on the next galley.
* Each galley will have at least one dock bar shown in it.  Several dock bars
* may be placed side-by-side inside one galley, unless there is insufficient
* room.  If there is insufficient room to place another dock bar, that dock bar
* will be moved to the next galley, even though its LAYOUT_DOCK_NEXT option
* is not set.  This implies that when the main window is resized and more room
* becomes available, it will jump back to its preferred galley.
* Within a galley, dock bars will be placed from left to right, at the given
* x and y coordinates, with the constraints that the dock bar will stay within
* the galley, and do not overlap each other.  It is possible to use LAYOUT_FILL_X
* and/or LAYOUT_FILL_Y to stretch a toolbar to the available space on its galley.
* The galleys are oriented horizontally if the dock site is placed inside
* a top level window using LAYOUT_SIDE_TOP or LAYOUT_SIDE_BOTTOM, and
* vertically oriented if placed with LAYOUT_SIDE_LEFT or LAYOUT_SIDE_RIGHT.
