/**
* Splitter window is used to interactively repartition
* two or more subpanels.
* Space may be subdivided horizontally (SPLITTER_HORIZONTAL, which
* the default) or vertically (SPLITTER_VERTICAL option).
* When the splitter is itself resized, the right-most (bottom-most)
* child window will be resized unless the splitter window is reversed;
* if the splitter is reversed, the left-most (top-most) child window
* will be resized instead.
* The splitter widget sends a SEL_CHANGED to its target
* during the resizing of the panels; at the end of the resize interaction,
* it sends a SEL_COMMAND to signify that the resize operation is complete.
* Normally, children are resizable from 0 upwards; however, if the child
* in a horizontally oriented splitter has LAYOUT_FILL_X in combination with 
* LAYOUT_FIX_WIDTH, it will not be made smaller than its default width,
* except when the child is the last visible widget (or first when the option
* SPLITTER_REVERSED has been passed to the splitter).
* In a vertically oriented splitter, children with LAYOUT_FILL_Y and 
* LAYOUT_FIX_HEIGHT behave analogously.
