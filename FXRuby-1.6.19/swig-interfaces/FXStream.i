* A stream is a way to serialize data and objects into a byte stream.
* Each item of data that is saved or loaded from the stream may be byte-swapped,
* thus allowing little-endian machines to read data produced on big endian ones
* and vice-versa.
* Data is serialized exactly as-is.  There are no tags or other markers
* inserted into the stream; thus, the stream may be used to save or load arbitrary
* binary data.
* Objects derived from FXObjects may be serialized also; whenever a reference to an
* object is serialized, a table is consulted to determine if the same object has
* been encountered previously; if not, the object is added to the table and then
* its contents are serialized.  If the object has been encountered before, only a
* reference to the object is serialized.
* When loading back a serialized object, new instances are constructed using
* the default constructor, and subsequently the object's contents are loaded.
* A special container object may be passed in which is placed in the table
* as if it had been encountered before; this will cause only references to this
* object to be saved.  The container object is typically the top-level document
* object which manages all objects contained by it.  Additional objects may be
* added using addObject(); these will not be actually saved or loaded.
